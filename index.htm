<h3 class="multicolortext">Call for Proposals</h3>
<p>
Most people’s lives in Canada today are connected to some form of digital technology. While technology brings benefits and conveniences to our daily lives, many forms of technology reinforce individual and systemic biases, and injustices.
</p>
<p>
Digital technologies have been shown to both replicate and amplify existing discriminatory social patterns. Algorithms and artificial intelligence have been shown to reinforce racial and gender stereotypes, social media has been used as a platform to promote hateful and violent speech, and privacy invasive tools, such as internet connected cameras, have been used as surveillance devices against populations already over policed and monitored, notably Black, Indigenous, People of Colour, and members of the LGBTQ2S+ community.
</p>
<p>
Despite these problems, technology has also provided unique opportunities for members of equity seeking groups. Smartphones have been used to film and expose racist police brutality, social media has been used to build solidarity and social movements, and digital tools have been developed that advance the lifestyles of people living with disabilities.
</p>
<p>
As digitalization increases, we can’t compute an equitable digital context without an understanding of those issues. We need those voices in tech, academic and social spaces. While there is an increase of thought leadership on these issues globally, we’re missing a conservation cognisant of Canadian-specific context, history, and colonialism.
</p>
<p>
The goal of this collection is to bridge this gap in Canadian studies and highlight technology issues that are relevant to members of equality seeking groups, such as Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour, members of the LGBTQ2S+ community, and people with disabilities; and people at the intersection.
</p>
<p>
Our goal is not just to explore these issues, but to amplify voices from those groups unrepresented in mainstream conversation about the digital context.
</p>
<p>
This call for research pieces, short essays and interviews seeks intersectional and equality-based pieces for an interdisciplinary collection. We welcome submissions from a variety of perspectives and academic disciplines, including law and policy, critical race studies, queer studies, disability studies, women’s studies, gender studies, criminology, communication, anthropology, sociology, education, psychology, public and administration studies. We also welcome contributions from activists, advocates, and people with lived experiences related to technology and equality. Members of these communities are invited to write about foundational technology issues, highlight the experiences of their communities, and envision a more equitable technological future. We are looking not only for traditional academic research, but also first-person narratives, short stories, and interviews.
</p>
<p>
Topics may include (but are not limited to):
</p>
<ul>

<li>Technologies that reinforce inequalities

<li>The history of the relationship between power and technology

<li>The use of technology to challenge systemic inequalities

<li>Proposals for policy, social, and legal changes that would promote a more equitable technological world

<li>Speculative story-telling imagining possible digital futures
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The collection will be published in open access on a dedicated website and an e-book.
</p>
<p>
Editors and other volunteer researchers will provide mentorship and advise to contributors who request or need guidance. Academic essays will be peer-reviewed to help contributor build their narrative and arguments.
</p>
<p>
Funding can be made available by the University of Ottawa Research Chair in Technology and Society for people outside of traditional academia that would require such support to free-up time to write their contribution.
</p>
<h3 class="multicolortext">Proposals</h3>
<p>
Interested contributors should send a 200- 400 word abstract or general concepts describing the essay they would propose for inclusion in the collection, along with a 100 word bio on the <strong><a href="#form" class="btn">submission form</a> by November 2nd, 2020</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Notification of acceptance for inclusion in the collection will be sent on a rolling basis and full essays (of 1,000 to 4,000 words) will be expected by December 15, 2020.
</p>
