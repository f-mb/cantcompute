<h3 class="multicolortext">Coming Fall 2022</h3>
<p>
Most people’s lives in Canada today are connected to some form of digital technology. While technology brings benefits and conveniences to our daily lives, many forms of technology reinforce individual and systemic biases, and injustices.
</p>
<p>
Digital technologies have been shown to both replicate and amplify existing discriminatory social patterns. Algorithms and artificial intelligence have been shown to reinforce racial and gender stereotypes, social media has been used as a platform to promote hateful and violent speech, and privacy invasive tools, such as internet connected cameras, have been used as surveillance devices against populations already over policed and monitored, notably Black, Indigenous, People of Colour, and members of the LGBTQ2S+ community.
</p>
<p>
Despite these problems, technology has also provided unique opportunities for members of equity seeking groups. Smartphones have been used to film and expose racist police brutality, social media has been used to build solidarity and social movements, and digital tools have been developed that advance the lifestyles of people living with disabilities.
</p>
<p>
As digitalization increases, we can’t compute an equitable digital context without an understanding of those issues. We need those voices in tech, academic and social spaces. While there is an increase of thought leadership on these issues globally, we’re missing a conservation cognisant of Canadian-specific context, history, and colonialism.
</p>
<p>
The goal of this collection is to bridge this gap in Canadian studies and highlight technology issues that are relevant to members of equality seeking groups, such as Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour, members of the LGBTQ2S+ community, and people with disabilities; and people at the intersection.
